## Part 1: Client Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with modern hooks and functional components
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management
- **Styling**: Mantine UI components + Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Data Flow & Cache Management Architecture

The client implements a sophisticated caching strategy to optimize performance and user experience:

#### 1. **Initial Data Prefetch Strategy** (`useFetchAndCacheTrades`)
- **Purpose**: Preloads all trade data on application startup or window refocus
- **Implementation**: Fetches complete trade dataset and populates React Query cache
- **Benefits**: Eliminates loading states for subsequent navigation, improves perceived performance

#### 2. **Hierarchical Data Access** (`useTrade` hook)
- **Location**: JournalContainer component (one level below App.js)
- **Function**: Retrieves trade data from cache or fetches if missing
- **Cache Strategy**: Intelligent cache updates with new data while maintaining existing entries
- **Performance**: Leverages prefetched data for instant access

#### 3. **Real-time Data Updates** (`useAddTrade`)
- **Functionality**: Handles new trade submissions with optimistic updates
- **Cache Management**: Updates both trade ID list and individual trade caches simultaneously
- **User Experience**: Immediate UI feedback while ensuring data consistency

### Key Benefits
- **Reduced API Calls**: Intelligent caching minimizes redundant network requests
- **Improved Performance**: Prefetching eliminates loading delays for core data
- **Better UX**: Smooth navigation and instant data access across the application

## Part 2: Server Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend Framework**: ASP.NET Core 9.0 with modern .NET features
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Entity Framework Core for data access
- **API Design**: RESTful API with comprehensive endpoint coverage
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Deployment**: Containerized deployment with Docker support

### Database Design & Entity Architecture

The system implements a well-structured entity model designed for scalability and performance:
