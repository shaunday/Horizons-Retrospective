Authentication process

The API relies on session-based authentication (often via cookies or bearer tokens).
The Gateway opens that session in your browser, and your code inherits it by connecting via the same local host domain and port. 
You may need to confirm the /auth/status endpoint or similar to validate session tokens.



1.
To resolve symbol names to IBKR’s internal IDs (like conid), use:
POST /trsrvr/secdef/search

Use GET /iserver/marketdata/history
(Historical data: REST endpoint /iserver/marketdata/history?conid={id}&period=1d&bar=5min.)
