1.
verify logic when filling up a trade (trade status)
remove last doesnt remove summary..
disable c controls while pending
max size on content + tooltip? + min text size?

2.
fix styling clutter
https 

add opened/closedat somehow (to overview?) 
opened = first activate date, close = closed date, remove props from trade make em getters

a drawer with explanations: 
component type groups, red line for missing
origin > Idea. Add a trade and fill it > Open. Pending while element is being filled up

3.
change-history modal/tooltip
Once an element is active, can restamp via popup (pick data/now) 
add context/jotai for user, saved sectors, parse via useHandleStatusUpdates, sectors combobox +  autofill
filter by : status first, date first, show: idea, interim, closed
filtering -... in client? / adjust data call api

4.
obfuscate amounts/costs for anon view - a method (in the user context?)
rq: refetch inverval, cache time, background fetching notificaion, pagination ?
