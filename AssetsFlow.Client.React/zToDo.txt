1.
more (styling) work on the rows .. remove border when collapsed? lement tag/status to be an icon just like trade status?
some issues on pending/status when adding/removing 1st pos/ evaluation
dont allow appply on restricted if random
same line for trade status and e/c button

2.
fix styling clutter
from limor: add trade - different color, more visible possibly upthere on the header area
from limor: title should be styled diff than the content, text aligned to the left
from limor - icons instead of text "+" etc - check zoom homepage?

add opened/closedat somehow (to overview?) 
opened = first activate date, close = closed date, remove props from trade make em getters

a drawer with explanations: 
component type groups, red line for missing
origin > Idea. Add a trade and fill it > Open. Pending while element is being filled up

3.
data into ele title (what other data?)
change-history modal/tooltip
Once an element is active, can restamp via popup (pick data/now) 
add context/jotai for user, saved sectors, parse via useHandleStatusUpdates, sectors combobox +  autofill
filter by : status first, date first, show: idea, interim, closed
filtering -... in client? / adjust data call api

4.
from limor: edit > expand the object and edit in place?
obfuscate amounts/costs for anon view - a method (in the user context?)
sector thoughts
rq: refetch inverval, cache time, background fetching notificaion, pagination ?
