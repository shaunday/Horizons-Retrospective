origin > Idea. Add a trade and fill it > Open. 
While a temp/pending trade is up = IsPending controls are disabled
AI: 
1. while an element is not active - disable c controls while pending?
3. verify timestamp is being updated on content update
4. verify null methods/responses stop chain
5. Once an element is active, can restamp via popup (pick data/now)

add opened/closedat somehow (to overview?) 
also opened = first activate date, close = closed date, remove props from trade make em getters

fix styling clutter
style for trade status

add context/rq for user, saved sectors, parse via useHandleStatusUpdates ?
sectors combobox +  autofill

a drawer with explanations: trade status, component type groups, red line for missing, trade state/pending

rq: refetch inverval, cache time, background fetching notificaion, pagination ?
https ?
