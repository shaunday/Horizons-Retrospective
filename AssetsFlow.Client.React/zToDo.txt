1.
some issues on pending/status when adding/removing 1st pos
dont allow appply on restricted if random
element tag/status should be an icon just like trade status

2.
fix styling clutter

add opened/closedat somehow (to overview?) 
opened = first activate date, close = closed date, remove props from trade make em getters

a drawer with explanations: 
component type groups, red line for missing
origin > Idea. Add a trade and fill it > Open. Pending while element is being filled up

3.
data into ele title (what other data?)
change-history modal/tooltip
Once an element is active, can restamp via popup (pick data/now) 
add context/jotai for user, saved sectors, parse via useHandleStatusUpdates, sectors combobox +  autofill
filter by : status first, date first, show: idea, interim, closed
filtering -... in client? / adjust data call api

4.
obfuscate amounts/costs for anon view - a method (in the user context?)
sector thoughts
rq: refetch inverval, cache time, background fetching notificaion, pagination ?
