If you’ve just installed PostgreSQL and haven't created a database yet, follow these steps to create a database and then execute the commands:

### 1. **Create a Database**:
   First, you need to create a database to use. Here’s how you can do that:
   
   - Open **pgAdmin 4** and connect to your PostgreSQL server.
   - In the left panel, right-click on the **Databases** node.
   - Select **Create > Database**.
   - In the dialog, enter a name for your database (e.g., `DayJournalDatabase`), and click **Save**.

### 2. **Open Query Tool**:
   Once the database is created, do the following:
   - In the left panel, expand the **Databases** section.
   - Right-click on your newly created database (`DayJournalDatabase`).
   - Select **Query Tool** to open a new SQL editor.

### 3. **Run Your SQL Script**:
   Now that you have a database, you can execute the SQL commands:

   Copy and paste the following SQL commands into the Query Tool:
   ```sql
   CREATE ROLE dayj_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'securepassword';
   GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE "DayJournalDatabase" TO dayj_user;
   GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO dayj_user;
   GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO dayj_user;
   ```

### 4. **Execute the SQL**:
   Click the **Execute/Refresh** button (or press `F5`) to run the commands.

After doing this, you should have:
- A `dayj_user` role created with login credentials.
- Permissions to connect to the `DayJournalDatabase` database.
- Access to the `public` schema with `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` permissions on all tables in that schema.
