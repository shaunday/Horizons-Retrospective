Ledger
Had a thought of creating Ledger as a micro service - worker + observer
The issue would've been keeping sync 
(Which you can do with event driven solution using Rabbit/Kafka or on the Sql level)
.... thing is Journal and Ledger dont need to scale, and theyre tied 1+1
decided to stay mono- 1 solution, code separation
