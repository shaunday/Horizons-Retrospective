1. a dockerfile to containerize the ASP.NET app 
 - publish using github actions  
 - a minimal Ubuntu-based image to keep the container lightweight

2. configured the server to listen on:
 - localhost in dev
 - :80 in the container

3. docker-compose.yml file to run the container locally

4. deploy.sh file to be ran on the compute instance:
  - docker install
  - docker compose install
  - image pull (using static address for now, + its public)
  - run using docker compose

5. Secrets_
 - .env file in a safe spot
 - mklink "...\AssetsFlow.Server\AssetsFlow.Web.API\.env" "G:\My Drive\...\AssetsFlow\.env"
 - create a ".gitignore" file in the AssetsFlow.Web.API folder and add .env
 - DotNetEnv to read env files

6. Supabase / DB connect
 - create supabase account + Database "HsR_Journal_Prod"
 - add connection/auth strings to env files
 - wrap up connection string getter, base on dev/prod
 - VERIFY MIGRATIONS FOLDER IS EMPTY
 - EntityFrameworkCore\Add-Migration InitialCreate -p HsR.Journal.Infrastructure -s HsR.Journal.Infrastructure
 - EntityFrameworkCore\Update-Database -p HsR.Journal.Infrastructure -s HsR.Journal.Infrastructure
 - (Connection string is set in the getter, used by the DesignTime ContextFactory)

7. Spin up an EC2 Free Tier
  - Make sure port 80 (or 443 if using HTTPS) is open in your EC2’s security group, ditto port 22 for SSH
  - Turn off credit spec: unlimited > standard
  - Attach deployment files (docker-compose.yml, deploy.sh, .env): 
    .. more/detailed info here: AssetsFlow.Server/deploy/Instructions.txt



Nice To Have:
  - Even for MVP, consider adding HTTPS via Nginx + Let’s Encrypt using Certbot /  use a managed solution like Cloudflare.
  - Expanding Compute to 2 services: set up subdomains /2 ports


🚀 AWS Strategy:
Start with EC2 Free Tier (t3.micro):
Install Docker, run your container.
Zero cost if you stay within limits.
After 12 months, you can switch to t4g.nano (ARM) or Lightsail to keep it cheap.

🔧 EC2: t4g.nano
EBS: 8GB gp3 (root volume only)
OS: Amazon Linux 2 ARM64
Software: Docker, your container
Total cost: ~$3.50/month (instance + EBS), possibly less with savings plans or spot

🔧 Lightsail = same price ($3.50) as EC2 t4g.nano + EBS combo — but:
You get x86 architecture (more image compatibility).
SSD + networking included.
You don’t pay for EBS separately.
