# TODO

- when passing an ew element tag it as new, is any missing prop too
- add demo DB
- redo seeder
- rethink activation/ summary (maybe summary all activated elements only?) HasMissingContent on element?
- on remove, reset activation states or just re-check. open = at least 1 add exists
- add opened/closedat somehow (to overview?) 
- opened = first activate date, close = closed date, remove props from trade make em getters? gotta be readonly anyhow
- re-open trade to allow edit?

## testing
- API tests (seeder?)

## dashboard + price alerts
- Indicator alerts, upcoming reports, trend watch

## ledger - populate brokers list with actual data

## nice to have
- Actual R:R in closure
- conluences check list = trends per tf, bb/ma distances
- filtering history
- users + authentication

## Expansion:
