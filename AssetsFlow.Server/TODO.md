# TODO

- redo seed + on demand with 3 good scenarios - controller + password (or straight up users)
- adjust grouping - less groups...
- split out analytics into a microservice

- add ignoreActivation flag to content edit
- add idea/origin date (not same as trade open)
- on remove, set condition where net is positive post, otherwise error

- rethink isContentMissing - either way dont need to reload all tradeComposite to get it, you always got the old one (in the fe at least)
- closed trade logic : deny edits/ re-open trade to allow edit?


## testing
- API tests (seeder?)

## dashboard + price alerts
- Indicator alerts, upcoming reports, trend watch

## ledger - populate brokers list with actual data
- position weight/ sector weight
- pies

## nice to have
- Actual R:R in closure
- conluences check list = trends per tf, bb/ma distances
- filtering history
- users + authentication

## Expansion:
