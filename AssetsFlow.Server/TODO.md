# TODO

- add demo DB
- rethink activation/ summary (maybe summary all activated elements only?) HasMissingContent on element?
- on remove, reset activation states or just re-check. open = at least 1 add exists
- add opened/closedat somehow (to overview?) 
- opened = first activate date, close = closed date, remove props from trade make em getters? gotta be readonly anyhow

## testing
- API tests (seeder?)

## dashboard + price alerts

## ledger - populate brokers list with actual data
