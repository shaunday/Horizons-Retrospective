# TODO

- when passing an ew element tag it as new, is any missing prop too
- add demo DB
- redo seeder

- rethink activation/ summary (maybe summary all activated elements only?) 
- add opened/closedat somehow (to overview?) 
- parsed in response missing in the info sent: ActivationTimeStamp, SavedSectors
- opened = first activate date, close = closed date (remove props from trade make em getters / readonly ?)

- re-open trade to allow edit?
- on remove, reset activation states or just re-check. open = at least 1 add exists

## testing
- API tests (seeder?)

## dashboard + price alerts
- Indicator alerts, upcoming reports, trend watch

## ledger - populate brokers list with actual data
- position weight/ sector weight
- pies

## nice to have
- Actual R:R in closure
- conluences check list = trends per tf, bb/ma distances
- filtering history
- users + authentication

## Expansion:
